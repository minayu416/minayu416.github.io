<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Building and designing my own personal website has always been a dream of mine.</p>
<p>Back when I was still getting familiar with software development, I started with WordPress to build my site. It was a great starting point, but I found myself craving more flexibility — I wanted greater control over how content was structured and displayed on the front end. That led me to explore other tools that would give me the creative freedom I was looking for.</p>
<p>In 2019, thanks to a recommendation from a former colleague, I discovered Hugo — a popular Jamstack framework known for its speed and SEO-friendly static site generation. Using Hugo, I rebuilt my personal website and began writing more consistently. Over time, the site grew from around 10,000 views on WordPress to over 300,000 page views today, with an average of 50+ daily visitors. (Most of my blog posts are written in Traditional Chinese.)</p>
<p>However, as a developer with a backend background in Python and recently transitioning into frontend development with JavaScript, I found Hugo’s reliance on Go (Golang) to be a bit of a hurdle. Customizing themes and experimenting with new UI ideas became increasingly limiting.</p>
<p>That’s what pushed me to take the next step — to find a path where I could keep learning modern frontend technologies while also having the flexibility to design and shape my personal site’s UI exactly the way I envision it.</p>
<h1 id="migrate-from-hugo-to-nextjs">Migrate From Hugo to Next.js</h1>
<p>Back when I was still in grad school, the modern frontend frameworks — React, Vue, and Angular — hadn't even been released yet. At that time, we were building websites using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or jQuery), typically combined with MVC architecture and backend technologies.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a couple of years ago, I began transitioning from backend to frontend development. When I first started learning Next.js, I was completely unfamiliar with different rendering strategies like CSR, SSR, SSG, and ISR. The nuances — and sometimes conflicts — between CSR and SSR gave me quite a headache. Compared to React.js, which uses a straightforward CSR model, and Hugo, which is based on static site generation (SSG), jumping straight into Next.js felt overwhelming. I tried multiple times to rebuild my Hugo blog with Next.js, but the learning curve — especially around rendering — kept holding me back.</p>
<p>There were a few major hurdles:</p>
<ul>
<li>My frontend knowledge was still limited, especially regarding rendering strategies, which made development difficult.</li>
<li>I had little experience optimizing for SEO, and I was concerned that the SEO performance wouldn’t match what Hugo had been effortlessly handling for me.</li>
<li>URL structure changes could seriously affect search engine rankings.</li>
</ul>
<p>My blog, built with Hugo, has been running for about 5–6 years and has accumulated over 300,000 page views, with around 50+ daily visitors. Many of the articles rank well on Google, thanks to Hugo's excellent SEO handling.</p>
<p>One critical SEO requirement is preserving the original URL structure. Any change could result in 404 Page Not Found errors or require redirects — both of which can hurt Google rankings.</p>
<p>The original URL structure in Hugo looked like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese homepage: <code>/</code></li>
<li>English homepage: <code>/en/</code></li>
<li>Chinese posts: <code>/&#x3C;year>/&#x3C;month>/&#x3C;slug></code></li>
<li>English posts: <code>/en/&#x3C;year>/&#x3C;month>/&#x3C;slug></code></li>
</ul>
<p>However, when I tried rebuilding the site using Next.js and its dynamic routing system (e.g., <code>/[lang]/page.js</code>), my URLs changed. For example, a post originally at <code>/2024/04/post</code> became <code>/zh-TW/2024/04/post</code>. That change broke the existing URLs and caused Google to lose track of the pages.</p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered a powerful feature in Next.js: <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments">Catch-all Segments</a>. By defining a dynamic route like <code>/[...routes]/page.js</code> and using <code>generateStaticParams</code>, I could define flexible route arrays, regardless of language or slug format.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passing <code>['en', '2024', '04', 'post']</code> gives <code>/en/2024/04/post</code></li>
<li>Passing <code>['2023', '01', 'post']</code> gives <code>/2023/01/post</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach allowed me to maintain the original URL structure (like <code>/2024/04/post</code>), ensuring existing search engine links would still work.</p>
<p>After figuring this out, I finally made the decision to migrate from Hugo to Next.js — and officially started the process of rebuilding my site.</p>
<h1 id="successful-migration-from-hugo-to-nextjs-seo-and-traffic-maintained">Successful Migration from Hugo to Next.js: SEO and Traffic Maintained</h1>
<p>After the full site refactor using Next.js, the official relaunch was on May 26, 2025. As of June 5, it has been nearly two weeks since going live. During this time, I closely monitored performance through Google Analytics (GA) and Google Search Console (GSC). The results so far have been quite positive—both traffic and SEO rankings have remained stable, indicating a smooth transition.</p>
<p>This is especially reassuring considering a previous attempt to migrate using Nuxt.js resulted in a significant SEO drop. So seeing these stable numbers now feels like a small victory.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-2025-06-08-at-4.49.43e280afpm.png" alt="Google Analytics"></p>
<p>Daily users and pageviews remain steady post-launch.</p>
<h2 id="search-console-metrics">Search Console Metrics</h2>
<p>In Google Search Console, both performance and indexing results mirrored what I observed in GA:</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-2025-06-08-at-4.50.25e280afpm.png" alt="Google Search Performance"></p>
<p>No major dip in impressions or clicks after switching to Next.js.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-2025-06-08-at-4.50.37e280afpm.png" alt="Google Search Indexing"></p>
<p>More valid pages are now detected and indexed.</p>
<p>Some of the non-indexed pages are likely outdated or contain old broken paths from earlier versions of the site. I plan to manually clean those up in future revisions.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeways">Key Takeways</h2>
<ul>
<li>No major drop in search rankings or traffic</li>
<li>No 404 errors from old links</li>
<li>Increased number of pages indexed by Google robots</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this migration wasn’t a waste of effort—it actually paid off. It not only maintained the existing SEO performance but also gave me valuable hands-on experience in SEO tuning and working with Next.js.</p>
<p>I’ve also been deepening my understanding of SEO, including tools and best practices such as <code>Schema.org</code> markup, Google <code>Lighthouse</code> audits, and structured data enhancements. At the same time, I’m re-evaluating my site’s content to ensure it's still engaging and relevant to readers.</p>
<p>Sure, my blog doesn’t pull thousands or tens of thousands of visitors a day like an e-commerce site. But unlike the failed Nuxt.js migration where traffic and rankings plummeted, this time the outcome was solid.</p>
<p>In the next section, I’ll share some of the key lessons and techniques I used to preserve and optimize SEO during the transition—hopefully, they’ll help others avoid common pitfalls.</p>
<h1 id="seo-key-points">SEO Key Points</h1>
<p>The Next.js version: 14.2.5</p>
<h2 id="1-metadata">1. Metadata</h2>
<p>Metadata provides structured information about each webpage, helping search engines like Google understand the content, language, author, and how the page should appear when shared on social platforms.</p>
<p>For every page you want indexed by Google—especially blog posts—it's recommended to define unique metadata. Here are the key components I used in my implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Info: title, description, and keywords. (Although the impact of keywords has decreased, it's still advisable to include around five.)</li>
<li>Favicon: A small tab icon to increase brand recognition and professionalism.</li>
<li>Additional Info: Such as generator, authors, and creator.</li>
<li>Robots.txt Configuration: Instructs search engine bots on which pages to index.</li>
<li>Alternates: Useful for multilingual websites; specify language-specific URLs.
Be sure the canonical URL is correct, or your shared links might lead to the wrong page.</li>
<li>openGraph (OG) &#x26; Twitter Tags: Define how your content appears when shared across platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining clear, relevant metadata for each page is crucial to strong SEO performance. Here is a sample metadata object implemented in <code>Next.js (v14.2.5)</code> based on my personal website:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const metadata = {

<h2 id="2-pages-need-seo-should-use-ssr-or-ssg">2. Pages need SEO should use SSR or SSG</h2>
<p>There are several frontend rendering methods like CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR, and Hydration. If you're not focused on frontend development, they can be hard to grasp. Let's skip the technical differences and remember the key point:</p>
<p><strong>Pages that need SEO should use SSR or SSG.</strong></p>
<p>If you're just building a personal website and unfamiliar with rendering methods, it's easier to use a <a href="(https://jamstack.org/generators/)">Jamstack framework</a> like Hugo that uses SSG by default. Choose a popular one with good community support.</p>
<p>For Next.js, configure the project like this for static export:</p>
<h4 id="1-configuration-in-nextconfigmjs">1. Configuration in <code>next.config.mjs</code></h4>
<pre><code class="language-js">const nextConfig = {
  output: "export",
  distDir: "out",
  // If add this line, the generated structure will be /blog/index.html or /2024/05/11/post/index.html when visit /blog/ or /blog, Github Page will direct to /blog/index.html。
  trailingSlash: true,
  // Change to your host url when deploying, this will direct to corract CSS/JS routes.
  assetPrefix: isDev ? "" : "&#x3C;hostname>",
};

export default nextConfig;
</code></pre>
<p>Run <code>npm run build</code> to generate the static site in the <code>/out/</code> folder.</p>
<h4 id="2-define-static-route-paramters">2. Define static route paramters</h4>
<p>All routes must be pre-generated. Next.js will automatically create static paths based on your folder structure.</p>
<p>If using dynamic routes like <code>[id]</code> or <code>[...routes]</code>, you must define them using <code>generateStaticParams</code>. Otherwise, the page won't be found (404 error).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// /divination/[method]/layout.js

const METHOD = ["runes", "tarot", "lenormand"];

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const params = [];

  METHODS.forEach((method) => {
    params.push({ method });
  });

  return params;
}

export default async function Layout({ children }) {
  return children;
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">// /[...routes]/layout.js

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const allPosts = await getAllPosts();
  const posts = allPosts.map((post) => {
    // For loop each post and define the route path
    return {
      routes: [post.lang, post.year, post.month,post.slug ];,
    };
  });

  // data:
  // [
  //    {routes: ['2024', '05', '11', 'my-first-post']},
  //    {routes: ['2024', '06', '11', 'my-second-post']},
  //    {routes: ['2024', '07', '02', 'my-third-post']}, ...
  // ]

  return [...posts];
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="3-avoid-whole-page-csr">3. Avoid whole page CSR</h4>
<p>If you add <code>"use client"</code> to the entire page, it becomes CSR and loses SEO benefits. Instead:</p>
<p><strong><em>Keep the main page as SSR/SSG</em></strong></p>
<p>Extract components that use hooks (e.g., Carousel) into separate files with <code>"use client"</code>, then import them back.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// carousel.js
"use client";
export function Carousel() {
  return &#x3C;>{/* TODO: Carousel */}&#x3C;/>;
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">// page.js
import { Carousel } from "@app/component/carousel";
export default function Page({ params: { lng } }) {
  return (
    &#x3C;>
      &#x3C;Header />
      &#x3C;Navbar />
      &#x3C;Carousel />
      &#x3C;Posts />
      &#x3C;Categories />
      &#x3C;Footer />
    &#x3C;/>
  );
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="4-check-pages-successfully-statically-generated">4. Check pages successfully statically generated</h4>
<p>How to check if your page was successfully statically generated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>npm run build</code> to generate static site.</li>
<li>Open the HTML file in <code>/out/</code> with a text editor (not a browser)</li>
<li>If you see <code>&#x3C;head></code> metadata and full <code>&#x3C;body></code> content, it's a valid static site (Make sure the metadata in head tag set correspondingly with you defined not the default value set in layout.js. Next.js will use the default or metadata in home page if it gets defined metadata failed.)</li>
<li>If you only see a single empty <code>&#x3C;div></code>, it's CSR and won't be SEO-friendly</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-suggestion-avoid-using-chinese-in-url-routes-slug">3. Suggestion: Avoid using Chinese in URL routes (slug)</h2>
<p>Since I migrated my blog several times, some posts (converted from WordPress .md files) didn’t have defined slugs and used Chinese filenames instead. This caused encoding issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>URL appears as: <code>/2024/05/11/我的第一篇文章</code></li>
<li>But becomes: <code>/2024/05/11/%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E7%AF%87%E6%96%87%E7%AB%A0</code> in actual requests</li>
</ul>
<p>Browsers and frameworks like Next.js try to handle encoding, but I still ran into decoding issues when building static pages. So I decided to define all slugs in English to avoid errors.</p>
<p>Also, Chinese URLs don’t perform well in SEO. I recommend defining English slugs manually:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/2024/05/11/我的第一篇文章</code> → <code>/2024/05/11/my-first-post</code></li>
<li><code>/blog/categories/旅行日記</code> → <code>/blog/categories/travel-diary</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That way, you avoid encoding problems and improve SEO.</p>
<p>If your framework handles Chinese URLs flawlessly, no need to change. I only did this after hitting multiple encoding issues.</p>
<h2 id="4-enable-sitemapxml-and-robotstxt-for-seo">4. Enable sitemap.xml and robots.txt for SEO</h2>
<h3 id="sitemap">sitemap</h3>
<p>A sitemap helps search engines understand your site's structure and update frequency. It’s an XML file usually located at the root: <code>public/sitemap.xml</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  &#x3C;url>
    &#x3C;loc>https://example.com/&#x3C;/loc>
    &#x3C;lastmod>2025-06-03&#x3C;/lastmod>
    &#x3C;changefreq>weekly&#x3C;/changefreq>
    &#x3C;priority>0.8&#x3C;/priority>
  &#x3C;/url>
&#x3C;/urlset>
</code></pre>
<p>To auto-generate it in Next.js, use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-sitemap">next-sitemap</a> package.</p>
<h4 id="1-create-next-sitemapconfigjs-and-configure-it">1. Create <code>next-sitemap.config.js</code> and configure it</h4>
<h4 id="2-additionalpaths-additional-path-needs-to-define-or-re-define-existing-paths">2. additionalPaths: additional path needs to define or re-define existing paths.</h4>
<p>The sitemap URLs automatically generated by the next-sitemap package with the current date. I don't know how to set the <code>lastmod</code> for different websites.</p>
<p>I checked the official documentation and found that you can overwrite the information of the existing paths by adding the paths again in <code>additionalPaths</code>, no duplicate path issues.</p>
<p>So I overwrite the posts lastmod by re-defining the paths and information as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">module.exports = {
  siteUrl: "https://&#x3C;your-domain>",
  generateRobotsTxt: true,
  outDir: "public",
  changefreq: "weekly",
  priority: 0.8,

  exclude: ["/blog/page/*", "/blog/category/*/page/*"],

  additionalPaths: async (config) => {
    // In layout.js, I have defined the paths before, but I want to overwrite the lastmod based on post date after auto-generating with current date.
    const posts = await getAllPosts();

    return posts.map((post) => {
      const prefix = post.lang === "en" ? "/en" : "";
      return {
        loc: `${prefix}/${post.year}/${post.month}/${post.slug}`,
        lastmod: post.date.toISOString(),
      };
    });
  },
};
</code></pre>
<h4 id="3-add-prebuild-sitemap-to-your-packagejson-scripts">3. Add prebuild sitemap to your package.json scripts:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-js">"scripts": {
  "prebuild": "next-sitemap",

}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="robottxt">robot.txt</h3>
<p>The <code>robots.txt</code> file tells search engines which paths to crawl. You can either:</p>
<p>Auto-generate it with next-sitemap (set <code>generateRobotsTxt: true</code>), or</p>
<p>Create it manually in your <code>public/</code> folder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">User-agent: *
Allow: /

Host: https://&#x3C;your-domain>
Sitemap: https://&#x3C;your-domain>/sitemap.xml

</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to replace the host with your actual domain and adjust exclusions if needed.</p>
<h2 id="5-deployment-settings-assetprefix-basepath-trailingslash-cname-nojekyll">5. Deployment Settings: assetPrefix, basePath, trailingSlash, CNAME, .nojekyll</h2>
<p>When deploying your site, the URL will differ from the local <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. It might use a custom domain or have a subpath like <code>/staging/</code>.</p>
<h4 id="1-cname">1. CNAME</h4>
<p>If you're using a custom domain, create a <code>CNAME</code> file in the <code>public</code> folder (no file extension) with your domain as the only line inside.</p>
<h4 id="2-nojekyll">2. .nojekyll</h4>
<p>Next.js puts assets in <code>_next/</code>. GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, which ignores folders starting with <code>_</code>. To fix this, create a <code>.nojekyll</code> file (empty, no extension) in the <code>public</code> folder.</p>
<h4 id="3-nextjs-config">3. Next.js Config</h4>
<pre><code class="language-js">// next.config.mjs
const nextConfig = {
  output: "export",
  distDir: "out",
  trailingSlash: true, // Ensures URLs like /blog/ work properly
  assetPrefix: isDev ? "" : "https://&#x3C;hostname>/", // For static asset URLs
  // basePath: "/staging", // Use this if your site is deployed under a subpath
};
export default nextConfig;
</code></pre>
<p>If images or CSS/JS files aren’t loading, check your config of <code>assetPrefix</code> and make sure <code>.nojekyll</code> is in place.</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts-continuous-optimization">Final Thoughts: Continuous Optimization</h1>
<p>Without the SEO optimization support provided by the Hugo framework, I realized that many things I once took for granted actually involve various technical details behind the scenes. After launching my website, I continued to explore more about SEO and made repeated adjustments to improve performance. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Google Lighthouse to audit the site and identify areas for improvement</li>
<li>Learning how to use <code>schema.org</code> to enhance SEO</li>
<li>Observing well-structured, high-ranking websites in search engine results and comparing them with my own to identify missing elements or areas that could be optimized.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this content helps you successfully deploy your website and set up SEO properly. I’m not an expert in frontend development or SEO—just sharing my personal experience in the hope that it might be useful to you!</p>2:[["$","header",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-auto","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"mx-auto flex flex-wrap border-b
