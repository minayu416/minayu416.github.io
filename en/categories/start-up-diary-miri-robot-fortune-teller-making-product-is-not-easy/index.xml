      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always think, as a software engineer, what&amp;rsquo;s my dream? What&amp;rsquo;s my next target and task?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote the story of how Miri was conceived in the Github README originally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I recently completed the development of the third version and was about to rewrite the README, I found that I should move the description here, plus I want to record my motivation and story of making Miri.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
